# sign-language-detection

This repository contains code from the paper "Sign Language Detection 'In the Wild' with Recurrent Neural Networks". I am fixing the code and adding some more features to the tools. Some of this code isn't working in tensorflow 2.5.0  

See readme.txt for futher information on how to use the code.
